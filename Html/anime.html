            <!-- <a>The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in Akihabara,
                where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective "future gadgets" with fellow lab
                members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed
                "Daru." The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed
                the "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.

                Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a
                scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of
                mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave can send emails to
                the past, altering the flow of history.

                Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe
                through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging threads of past
                and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time. -->
